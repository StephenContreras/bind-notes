#### Description
This is a fairly large stone building that shows some sign of wear but is fairly well maintained. The walkway from the road is a nice dark gray brick pathway and the windows by the main entrance have stained glass windows portraying a mountain with rains on one side and another with lush hills and an enlarged strand of wheat on the other. - This is to show how Grasspass is the heart of the breadline that runs through Falsen.

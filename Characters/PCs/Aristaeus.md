###### Backstory

Aristaeus is the generic name given to a religious pariah in the l[[Cult of Aristaeus]], the God of Bees and Beekeeping. Temples to Aristaeus are popular among the original inhabitants of the land, and has become especially popular with an elf immigrant population. Aristaeus was expelled from a moderately well respected position within one of the local temples (partially due to her spirit of the land blood ties) for appealing to high priestesses to work with the burgeoning population along the coast as they developed and grew into a city. She argued for green solutions, innovative sustainable modernization, that would benefit the land and the city - she was expelled immediately and ordered to do penance so great that it is unlikely she will ever return to the cult. As an embodiment of the land Aristaeus form changes as the area changes - from nymph like to steampunk to whatever the future holds Aristaeus is ready for change.

###### Penance

Live as an outcast for the foreseeable future - cannot make contact with the temples or its current flock. Aristeaus keeps to the traditions of the temple as they can - beekeeping, making mead, and focusing on an environment as a living being to be respected. As it stands, there is no end to this punishment as Aristeus’ stance is a political one in addition to a danger to the current order of religious leaders. The priest class insists on tradition. A constant in an ever changing world. But they do not see what Aristeaus does. Religion is dying in the face of industrialization. Who believes in the old gods when technology has replaced them?

###### Age

Aristaeus is over 300 years old, though she has forgotten her exact age. Elves live long lives, but spirits of the land are ageless taking form as they need as long as the land remains mostly intact, even transforming as the land does from land to water to mountain spirits. With age has come wisdom, though not quickly or as usefully as Aristaeus would like. Her first 150 years were spent in the folly of youth - excessive indulgence in material wealth and a tendency towards risk that Aristaeus has not fully let go of. Some think she is the vigilante Legion who was known for targeting corrupt business leaders who profited off of shortcuts that harmed the environment, as well as politicians that  passed anti - environment legislation. The most recent years have been dedicated to her crafts - beekeeping, gardening, baking, candle making, and animal handling ad she can not dedicate her life to the temple as she did in her later youth.

###### Daily Life

Early to rise, Aristeaus tends to the chickens and animals before harvesting vegetables, herbs, and honey as needed. She starts baking early in the morning after that so there’s fresh bread for breakfast and patisseries for the bakery at opening. By mid morning the baking is done, and Aristeaus can complete and household (or neighborhood) repairs before lunch. Lunch typically brings friends and travelers alike to her door as afternoon baking is underway, and the afternoon is dedicated to the more medicinal arts - salves, wound treatment, and herbal blends are dispensed by Aristeaus with the help of more practiced herbalists, witches, and doctors as needed by the community. These are volunteers that use their time off to support the community and help it flourish.

###### Currently Living

In a suburban cottage (#cottagecore) within walking distance of the light rail into town, Aristeaus keeps bees, chickens, and runs a small bakery and community garden for the surrounding area. While mostly self sustaining, there are other members of the community ready to step in and take over as a moments notice, as Aristeaus had to travel for temple business in their former position.

###### Backstory 

A birth foretold by astrologists and alchemists, Asterion was supposed to be a great king, or the end of an empire. Warring factions were brought to a wary peace with the promise of a leader with the guidance of the stars. As the prophecy suggested, the birth would be one like no other - with Queen Circe was bewitched by a local land spirit it seems that the prophecy was finally coming to pass. 

###### And yet...

When Asterion was  born the peace seemed cemented. There was just one problem. It was all a lie. Queen Circe brought Asterion forth as the son everyone needed, instead of the daughter that would end her empire. Asterion lived a lie for almost a century, a short time for an elf, until the one person who knew the truth was assassinated. In the turmoil of a court in the throngs of upheaval Asterion made a choice - to rule in the visage of the King they wanted. This brought peace for a time, until a spy found their way into Asterion's chambers and revealed the truth to the court, and the world. 

Fleeing, Asterion found shelter and aide in a local branch of the those faithful to Aristaeus - the god of bees and beekeeping. While an acolyte, Asterion became environmental vigilante, though their opinions were controversial and led to her expulsion and the taking of the name of the ostracized - Aristaeus.

#### Background
Age: 36 at time of death
###### History
- originally from the island of Puthawanan
	- off the coast of Sessid
	- loosely based off of Puthawanan from pg 81 of Sina Una
	- fishing community of mostly humans and elves
	- left the island around the age of 20 to see the world
	- no known family on the island
		- *or at least, none Leo has ever heard of*
		- then again, she was very secretive about her origins
- worshipped standard Elven gods, plus the Moon Triplets which are Puthawanan-exclusive
	- Mayari (pg 26, Sina Una)
	- Tala (pg 28)
	- Hanan (pg 29)
	- taught Leo and Cas all about them Sunday school-style
- Eren rescued her from having to work in an abusive circus
	- she was ~22, he was ~23
	- adventured with him from then on; couldn't stand him at first
	- love was a slow burn after many near death experiences
- was a rogue (scout subclass)
	- wielded a kris and a songil
		- details on pg 207 of Sina Una
		- think a fancy dagger and spear
- had Cas (on accident) at age of 25ish
- had Leo at around 28-29
- died at around 36 under mysterious circumstances
	- went on an adventuring job that was supposed to be easy and came back in a body bag
	- was planning to bring Eren and their sons to Puthawanan someday after this mission

###### Personality
- hair trigger temper. feisty
- often cursed around the kids
